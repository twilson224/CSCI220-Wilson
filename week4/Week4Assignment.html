        <h1>The Experiment</h1>
        
        <!-- Description of the experiment-->
        <p>College students consume surprising quantities of caffeine on average. This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's grade point average in school.
            The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national average <img src="caffeine.jpg" alt="Caffeine" align="right"  style="width:275px;height:225px;">(Group A), a group which received twice the national daily average (Group B), and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). 
            Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight and steady increase in GPA throughout the term. A higher than average consumption of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the semester. Finally, no consumption of caffeine led to neither a significant increase or decrease in overall GPA performance.</p>

        <h1>Procedure</h1>
        
        <!-- Adds an ordered list for the procedure-->
        <ol>
            <li>100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3. </li>
            <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100</li>
            <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C</li>
            <li>Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average)</li>
            <li>Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day</li>
            <li>Group C was given a placebo</li>
            <li>Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted</li>
        </ol>
